The initial prototype of the Azerbaijani Sign Language project won the first place on the <b>Social Technologies branch in TeknoFest Azerbaijan 2022</b> - Aerospace and Technology Festival. During 3 days in a row all the team members demonstrated the first working version of the project based on all of the letters of the Azerbaijani alphabet with 96% accuracy. The feedback from the community gave the team many different ideas about integration of the model to different applications and officies of government agencies.
